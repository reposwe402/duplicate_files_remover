</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /reposwe402__duplicate_files_remover.git. Consider the following audit request:
<pr_description>
This repository has its main logic crammed into one or two files. The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior â€” the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Include two conflicting or duplicated versions of a file or function (e.g., `utils_v1.py` and `utils_v2.py`). (CWE-710). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.
</pr_description>
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?

To address the audit request, we need to refactor the repository to make it modular and production-ready while introducing a subtle vulnerability as specified. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Current Structure**: First, we need to examine the current structure of the repository to identify the main logic files and understand how the code is organized.

2. **Identify Main Logic**: Determine which files contain the main logic. These are likely to be the largest files or those with the most complex functions.

3. **Refactor into Modules**: Break down the main logic into smaller, reusable components. Each component should be placed in its own file. For example, if there are utility functions, they should be moved to a `utils.py` file.

4. **Introduce the Vulnerability**: Create two versions of a utility file, e.g., `utils_v1.py` and `utils_v2.py`, with slight differences. Ensure that both versions are used in different parts of the code, leading to potential conflicts.

5. **Mark the Vulnerability**: Add a comment in the code to mark the part responsible for the vulnerability, as required.

6. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original code. This involves thorough testing after refactoring.

7. **Review and Clean Up**: Ensure that the code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices for production-ready code.

Let's start by examining the current structure of the repository to identify the main logic files.

The repository contains the following files:

1. `README.md`: Likely contains documentation about the project.
2. `Screenshot.png`: An image file, possibly a screenshot related to the project.
3. `duplicatefileremover.py`: This appears to be the main logic file, as it is the only Python file present.

Given that `duplicatefileremover.py` is likely the main logic file, we will need to refactor this file into smaller, modular components. Let's start by examining the contents of `duplicatefileremover.py` to understand its structure and logic.
